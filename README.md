## History of Sage-Combinat
Sage-Combinat started back in 2008, as a reincarnation of a similar
project MuPAD-Combinat (MuPAD is nown owned by MathWorks
& we switched the underlying platform from MuPAD to Sage).
At some point Sage-Combinat was a tightly knit group of
about 30 people working together on the core combinatorics feature;
this required tight coordination and a common location for sharing
in-development code (which was the Sage-Combinat queue).

## Purpose

We want the combinat.sagemath.org website to work for historical reasons:
for example, being a part of the Sage CAS, many publications include the
website in a citation.

Most pages should redirect to a suitable http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat
page. Check the /misc and /publications folders for publications that we are
keeping for the above reasons.
